## Introduction
When we read mathematical description of an argument, theorem, or a question, what our intuitive mental reaction to those MATH LANGUAGE will be treating them as natural language, and use our brains’ decoding system for natural language to understand those seemingly natural language.

But the question is, even when we surely understand the language of the mathematical description we read about, we may still utterly know nothing about the mathematical facts, or situation there.

For example, we understand what’s “vector” and what’s “linearly independent”, but when they show up in a mathematical description, let’s say, “there exist v1, v2, v3 which are linearly independent such that w1 = v1 + v2, w2 = v2 + v3, w3 = v3 + v1”, you may use your mental power as a barbaric chimpanzee, only caring about how they looks like, pronounces like, or a little bit advanced, caring about how they can be translated into formal but abstract expression in mathematical, while automatically forget to give a try to “understand” the truly meaning beneath the hybridized language, for example “what objects are v1, v2, v3, w1, w2, w3?”, “what other properties can be inferred from the L.I. family of vectors v1, v2, v3?”

The ignorance may be so naturally that someone might never realize that the only reason that leads to his failure in learning 10 years’ mathematic is that he have never even “understand” a single piece of mathematics.

So since the point of reading mathematical descriptions is intentionally decoding them in a mathematical way, rather than in a lazy, and natural way, then how should we decode the mathematical description in a “right” way?

Here are the two steps that I think is cruicial for decoding mathematical language.

## Preparation Step: Making mathematical symbols easier to read
To make mathematical symbols easier to read, i.e. to gain the mathematical literacy. When we study mathematics, we always first manage to understand basic concepts, and then receive a lot of traing of synthesizing those concepts. This step helps us configure “the mathematical contexts” in our mind over a mathematical description in a more rapid, 
and accurate thinking pattern.

## Key Step: Actively imagining.(Configuring contexts in your mind)
I would like to take the idea of Object-Oriented-Programming(OOP) for example, only for the sake of comprehending.

Human brain works in a comprenhensively different way when compared to the modern computer at the hardware level, but it will be beneficial for us to meditate on the nuance between how humans and programs solve a mathematical problem. When human arbitrarily store the mathematical objects’ details somewhere in your brain by intuition, and build connections between those details with the help of the axeons of nureons, an OOP programme store all the attributes and possible mathematical operations that a mathematical object may have somewhere at the memory consecutively. When a programme want to solve a strictly defined mathematical problem, all the “context” of that problem should be declared unambiguously. Analogizing to the programme’s way of declaring all aspects of the mathematical context precisely, human trying to map the mathematical details to the arbitrarily stored knowledge and imagine the mathematical model in their mind.

This is exactly what I mentioned in the previous sample of mathematical description as “understanding mathematics.” When you treating a piece of mathematical description as natural language, you may have the ability to articulate the definition of every mathematical concept that description touches, but we say that “you don’t understand the mathematical facts, or situation here.” Why? Cause if your don’t map your comprehension of those concepts to their exact instance within the description for yourself, no one will do it for you. You may understand the general sense of the enormous mathematical background or vague connections between your knowledges, but you will never understand the details of the mathematical facts here, how those mathematical details subtlely interact with each other in a nuanced manner. Finally, you cannot build the image of the mathematical model described by the mathematical language, not to mention knowing how to creatively operate on that mathematical model, and exerting rigourous inference.

Actively imaging during the reading processes of mathematical description can be far more laborious than our intuitive perception, whereas it well worth the labor cause it brought irreplaceable convenience for creatively mathematical thinking as I will explain 
in the following.

## Bravely speculating. (Randomly legal operations)

The only reason that free human from being the slave of computer within the realm of mathematics may be that we think creatively
