- To learn math means to learn an axiomatic system, a **Math Book** introduce such an axiomatic system

    Similarly, a **Chapter** within introduce an module of an axiomatic system

    → Read a Math Book = Read + [Interpret](http://boyan-nyu.com/2018/09/14/Interpreting-the-Language-of-Math/) an axiomatic system

    - Read an axiomatic system = Learn the universal language, used to communicate
    - [Interpret](http://boyan-nyu.com/2018/09/14/Interpreting-the-Language-of-Math/) an axiomatic system = [Interpret](http://boyan-nyu.com/2018/09/14/Interpreting-the-Language-of-Math/) with your own language, used to think

    → Take notes for a math book = Record your mapping from universal language to your own language over an axiomatic system， that is: *f ( universal language) → own language*

    → Do Exercises after reading = Test and Debug your interpretation over the axiomatic system (your own language)

    → Why should I read math books to study math?

    - Develop your own language from universal language, **NOT** from others' language (like: lectures presented by a professor, or notes borrowed from an alumni) ← people make mistakes, you'll inherit their BUGs too!  **AND**  their language is ALWAYS simplified for expression, **NOT** for interpretation!
    - A universally communicable language is necessary for a lot of purpose (like: education, communication, collaboration..)
    - A classic book, most of the time, is nearly a bug-free interpretation over an axiomatic system after decades of debugging

    → Why should I take notes for math book?

    - Shorten the time to spend each time to construct a language system assisting thinking over problems that involves the axiomatic system presented in the book (construct your interpretation from your previous interpretation, sounds sweet right?)
    - Shorten the time to spend each time to **debug** interpretation over modules

    → Why I should do Exercise after reading?

    - **Test** the validity of your interpretation over an axiomatic system
    - **Debug** the cause of failure from your interpretation

    → Why I think the importance: Take Notes > Doing Exercise ?

    - Exercises are problems testing your interpretation over slice(s) of module(s) of an axiomatic system ( that is, your language, instead of universal language; otherwise reliance on books to solve problems will be universal...)→ Good performance indicates **ONLY** good interpretation over slice(s) of module(s), **NOT** good interpretation over the module(s) beneath as a whole ( Sure, as exercises →∞, such indication →∞ ...)
    - Bad interpretation over slice(s) revealed by failure over an exercise, always implies bad interpretation over the whole module beneath **OR** its pre-req modules → such bad interpretation cannot be fixed independently **AND** only fixable systematically ( **MUST** reconstruct the whole interpretation over that module → Require heavy reading on itself and pre-reqs to debug the bad interpretation)
    - Final exams always presents problems to test your overall interpretation over an axiomatic system, **NOT** independent modules  → buggy but systematic interpretation > bug-free but fragmented interpretation
