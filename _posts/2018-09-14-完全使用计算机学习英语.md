When I was exposed to mathmatical texts as a kid, everytime when I read mathematical description which is full of weird notations, abstruse theorems, and abstract symbols, my intuitive interpretation to those math language was based on their interior logic and sense as natural language, instead of as abstractions.

Until recently, I realize this terrible habit, fostered under mistaken guidance during childhood, doesn't naturally vanish with exposure to a more formally organized system of language of math. I'm still not used to put those notations, theorems, and symbols in their “mathematical contexts” (the set of directly related abstractions) to interpret, while my imagination was so tightly constrainted by the vocabulary, grammer and coherence that adhere those abstractions to a verbally intelligible piece of description.

I found such harmful interpretion of the language of math leads to a slaggish, opaque thinking pattern for me. As the function that map the space of linguistic abstraction to the space of mathematical abstraction itself is impossible to explicitly define, the result of my interpretation through a flawed mapping is unpredictable. The status of my interpretation for certain description is same as the status of Schrödinger's cat, both sensical and nonsensical, so that rough and unreliable to use as brick to construct greater abstractions.

Interpreting the langauge of math in a mathematical way is also difficult to articulate with the flawed mapping mentioned. So maybe instead of a rational explanation, a perceptual one makes more sense.

Meditation on the interpretation of math by computer, applied to solve real mathematical problems, might be a good start.

With the idea of Object-Oriented-Programming(OOP), a self-consistent system of math is an"[class](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Class_(computer_programming))" with unambiguously defined "[attributes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attribute_(computing))"(meta-data) and "[methods](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Method_(computer_programming))"(opetations); a math problem solvable by computer is then an "[object](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Object_(computer_science))" derived from that "[class](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Class_(computer_programming))" with specified values of those "[attributes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attribute_(computing))," and there exists a solution in form of program which is a series of operations referencing or modifying"[attributes](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Attribute_(computing))" through some of the "[methods](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Method_(computer_programming))" defined.

In my view, the most entrenched discrepancy between computer and human's interpretation of language of math is that: computer constructs self-consistency through data and operations, while human constructs through creativity, but the idea is the same: "construct self-consistency." The shape of self-consistency for the same thing is various amoung different people constructed through different text, like the concept of "vector" is abstructed differently by mathmaticians, physicians, and computer scientists. Therefore I would say, interpreting the langauge of math in a mathematical way, is the same with constructing self-consistency through text in your own way.
